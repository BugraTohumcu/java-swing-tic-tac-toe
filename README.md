## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project implements the game logic and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Swing library.

## Features

- Graphical user interface with buttons for the game board
- Score tracking for both players
- Reset button to start a new game
- Highlighting of winning cells when a player wins
- End game functionality when a player wins or the board is full


## Usage
Once the game is running, you can click on the buttons to place your mark on the board. The game will track the score and highlight winning cells when a player wins. Use the reset button to start a new game.
